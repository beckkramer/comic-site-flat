# Flat Version of Comic Site

This is the Flat PHP version of a simple site I made for my webcomic, Relativity.
Certain things are currently too specific for my liking (a folder per chapter/part,
some hardcoded values that would be better served from the database, etc), but
overall it's been a reliable setup for my needs.

I plan to convert it to Symfony soon, to make it more scalable and useful for other
people to use for their own webcomics if they'd like.

All page images have been removed.
